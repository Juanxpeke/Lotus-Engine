# Lotus Engine

A GPU-Driven renderer for performant rendering of scenes with thousands of objects.



## Backend

The current backend of the renderer is OpenGL 4.6.



## Structure

### Engine

The engine consists of a single static library called LotusEngine, all its code is inside the ```source``` folder. 

### Tests

There are tests inside the ```tests``` folder, the tests are divided into visual (```visual``` folder) tests and unit tests using GTest (TODO).

### Examples

You can find examples showing most of the functionalities of the engine in the ```examples``` folder.


## Setup

If you want to have the project in your device:

- Clone the project with ```git clone https://github.com/Juanxpeke/Lotus-Engine```
- Update the third party modules with ```git submodule update --init --recursive```

## Building

There is a Makefile for running the necessary CMake commands for the build:

- ```make```: Builds the project
- ```make clean```: Cleans the build files 

You can also run the commands directly with CMake. The following list of commands is suggested (running on the root folder):

- ```mkdir build```
- ```cd build```
- ```cmake ../```



## Compiling

### Visual Studio

Just open the solution (```LotusEngine.sln```) generated by CMake and use the Visual Studio GUI to compile the library and executables.



## Running

### Visual Studio

Just as with the compiling, use the Visual Studio GUI.
